# firefox-startpage
Startpage/Launchpad for a broswer written in only HTML/CSS.

The box containing items scales to fit more as they are added. Since there is nothing used except for basic HTML/CSS, it should be easy to use with any browser or OS, so long as you are able to set the start page of you browser to a custom URL.
